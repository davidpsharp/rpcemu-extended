/*
 * machine_ipc - the local transport between the Manager window and a
 * machine running in its own "--managed" process.
 *
 * Two halves, deliberately not VNC/RFB and not any remote-desktop protocol:
 *
 *   - SharedFramebuffer: the video path. The managed child publishes each
 *     completed frame into a memory-mapped region shared with the Manager
 *     process (POSIX shm_open()/mmap(), Windows CreateFileMapping()) - the
 *     Manager reads pixels directly out of it with no socket copy and no
 *     encoding, the same way EmulatorPanel already reads them out of a
 *     buffer that VIDC produced when both lived in one process. Triple-
 *     buffered so a writer can never be observed mid-frame by a reader
 *     without needing a lock on the hot path.
 *
 *   - MachineIpcServer/MachineIpcClient: the control path, a small local
 *     socket (AF_UNIX on Linux/macOS, TCP loopback on Windows, mirroring the
 *     transport selection hostcmd.c and debugcmd.c already use for their own
 *     local control channels). It carries only small fixed-size messages -
 *     input, disc/reset/exit requests, and a handful of status events - never
 *     pixels. Request handlers on the server side call straight into
 *     EmulatorHost's public methods, which are already safe to call from a
 *     foreign thread (see EmulatorHost::PostCommand): the VNC server's own
 *     keyboard/pointer callbacks do exactly this today.
